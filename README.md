## 🔧 Configuration

### TypeScript

The project uses TypeScript with strict mode enabled for better type safety. Configuration can be adjusted in:
- `tsconfig.json` - App TypeScript config
- `tsconfig.node.json` - Node/Vite TypeScript config

### ESLint

ESLint is pre-configured with React-specific rules. Customize rules in `.eslintrc.cjs` to match your team's coding standards.

### Vite

Vite configuration can be modified in `vite.config.ts`. The starter includes:
- React plugin with Fast Refresh
- Optimized development experience
- Production build optimizations

## 🎨 Adding Popular Libraries

### React Router (Navigation)

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### State Management Options

**Zustand (Lightweight):**
```bash
npm install zustand
```

### Styling Solutions

**Tailwind CSS:**
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### API & Data Fetching

**React Query:**
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

**Axios:**
```bash
npm install axios
```

## 🏗️ Building for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. These files are:
- ✅ Minified and optimized
- ✅ Code-split for better performance
- ✅ Ready to deploy to any static hosting service

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```
